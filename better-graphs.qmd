# Show the Data

## As much as you can

# Declutter with Gestalt

Gestalt psychologists emphasize that organisms perceive entire patterns or configurations, not merely individual components.

"the whole is more than the sum of its parts."

The whole data visualization process is somehow a gestalt process.

{r}
library(tidyverse)

dat <- 
  tibble(
    x = runif(30, 10, 40),
    y = x + rnorm(length(x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n())


dat %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = x,
      y = y) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = 'id')

dat %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = x,
      y = y) +
  geom_point()

Especially the grouping rules can be used to declutter a data visualization.
